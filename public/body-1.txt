Pollution 
The introduction of dangerous items into the environment is referred to as pollution. Pollutants are the term for these dangerous compounds. Pollutants can come from the environment, such as volcanic ash. They can also be caused by human activities, such as garbage or factory runoff. Pollutants wreak havoc on the environment, including the air, water, and land.

Many items that are beneficial to individuals pollute the environment. Automobiles emit pollutants through their exhaust pipes. The air is polluted when coal is used to generate energy. Garbage and sewage are produced by industries and households, which can damage the land and water. Pesticides, which are chemical poisons used to eliminate weeds and insects, contaminate streams and endanger wildlife. Pollution is a worldwide issue. Despite the fact that metropolitan regions are typically more polluted than rural areas, pollution can migrate to isolated areas where no one lives. Pesticides and other pollutants, for example, have been discovered in the Antarctic ice sheet. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a massive concentration of microscopic plastic particles in the middle of the northern Pacific Ocean.

The environment is a hot topic in the headlines these days, and rightfully so. Climate change is threatening to alter our daily lives in nearly unfathomable ways, and it is already having long-term consequences that are harming the people and animals who live on our planet. Environmental challenges are highlighted when natural disasters strike communities, in addition to deforestation and melting glaciers. While we prefer to conceive of the environment on a global scale, it actually refers to a person's or animal's immediate surroundings. An environment can be a workplace, a school, or a house in this context. On a bigger scale, however, the global environment encompasses the entire planet. Both are prone to human-caused enhancements and damage, which can have a negative impact. While many people think of the environment as the natural world, which is one way of looking at it, each person also has an own environment, which might differ from one person to the next. A school may be a student's daily surroundings.

The everyday environment of a professional may be an office, whereas stay-at-home parents' daily settings are their homes. Humans used to live primarily outside, seeking temporary shelter in natural landscapes such as caves and forest canopies as their primary environments. Humans, on the other hand, began to develop more complicated structures to make up their habitats throughout millennia. They came to realize that they needed to do more to preserve those settings. There is ongoing evidence that it is a problem no matter where a person livesThe process by which the earth's total temperature rises over time is known as global warming. The repercussions of this rise in temperature can be seen and recorded in anything from ocean temperatures to average temperatures in different climates around the world, as well as an increase in weather-related natural disasters. Despite the fact that the global climate has always fluctuated, scientists are concerned that the globe has been getting hotter quicker in recent decades, owing in large part to human-caused global warming
